# PreGov
Know the impact of your governance decisions before you make them (UI Web).

## How to run
There is a mock server that is being used to serve the data from `db.json`. Both the mock server and client has to be run. Use `npm run dev` to start both concurrently.

_Note: The current netlify deployment doesn't render the data as the backend is not hosted and lives in localhost_
